## **Pre-Requirements** üìã  
- Install Docker  
Here is the official link to download it: https://www.docker.com/get-started/  
- Why Docker?  
Docker will allow you to launch the API service and connect it to the database.

---

## **Installation** üîß 
- Once the project is cloned, go to the project directory and run this command:
  ```
  docker compose up -d
  ```  
  This command will start the API service and it will be ready to be consumed.

---  

## **HTTP Endpoints** :desktop_computer: 
By default the API exposes port `:5050` 

To access endpoints that include the path parameter `/api`, they will need to send a token as an `Authorization` header. This token is generated when a registered user [logs in](#login).

- ### **Home**  
Shows a welcome message indicating that the connection has been made successfully.  

  `GET` `http://localhost:5050/`  

  Server Response:  

  ```
  { 
    "message": "Welcome to the Social Network API", 
    "status": true 
  }
  ```  

- ### **Read Posts**
Calling this endpoint will return a paginated list of all posts published by users. By default, a list page will contain 2 resources. If you want to change that, just add a query parameter `size` to the GET request. If you want to go to the next page, use the query parameter `page`. By the way, the pages start counting from zero.

  `GET` `http://localhost:5050/posts`

  Server Response: 

  ```diff
  [
    {
        "id": "2D5x9W6yoCZRLPkLbcxvi2HSwuC",
  !      "post_content": "Hello everybody, this is my first post",
        "created_at": "2022-08-08T23:49:55.628695Z",
        "user_id": "2D5sgDWHKO49madbrOSVCOr2hz0"
    },
    {
        "id": "2D5yTeD0YCtlrP2tTdqHY8SEori",
  !      "post_content": "This is my second post",
        "created_at": "2022-08-09T00:00:48.239374Z",
        "user_id": "2D5sgDWHKO49madbrOSVCOr2hz0"
    }
  ]
  ```  

  Example using query parameters:  

  `GET` `http://localhost:5050/posts?size=4&page=1`

  This call returns the second page of posts in a list of 4 resources.

  Server Response: 

  ```diff
  [
